# How to use the service

- We can access the endpoints, and test them, by accessing the following url, once the service is up:
  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


### First we need to create our user. 
  - Using the `/user/signUp` endpoint
  - Here is an example of payload: 
    - *We are creating an ADMIN*


    {
        "email": "test@mail.com",
        "name": "test",
        "password": "pass",
        "role": "ADMIN"
    }

- After signing up we should signIn
  - Using the `/user/signin` endpoint
  - This is how the payload is (you should use your data):


    {
      "email": "test@mail.com",
      "password": "pass"
    }

### After signing in we need to get the token that it generates to use for another requests

 ---

### Now you can create and delete some drinks and toppings, 
#### *IF YOU ARE AN ADMIN*
  - Creating 
    - you need to post in the `/drinks` endpoint
    - You also need to pass your `token` in the requestParam field
    - Here is an example of payload:


    {
      "name": "water",
      "price": 1
    }

  - Deleting
    - you need to use the endpoint `/drinks/{id}`. 
    and send a `delete` request instead of `post`
    

### To create and delete toppings the process is the same, just change drinks for toppings in the endpoint:
  - `post` -> `/toppings` = create
  - `delete` -> `/toppings/{id}` = delete 
---
### Using the cart

- you need to send a `post` to `/cart/add` to include products to cart
  - you need to send the `body` and the `token`
  - this is an example of payload:


    {
      "quantity": 1,
      "drink": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "water",
        "price": 1
      },
      "toppings": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "milk",
          "price": 1
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Lemon",
          "price": 1
        }
      ]
    } 


*After adding a product, the return will show you the complete cart with the total cost
  and the cost after applying the discount*


- If you need to delete an item of your cart you need to send a `delete` 
request to `/cart/delete-item/{itemId}`
  - you also need to send the `token`

- If you need to update and item you need to send a `post` 
to `/cart/update-item/` and send the body of your drink
- and also you send the id of you cart item
- and, as always, you need to send the `token`
- here is an example


    {
      "id": 1,
      "drink": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "water",
        "price": 1
      },
      "toppings": [
        {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "milk",
        "price": 1
        }
      ],
      "quantity": 2,
    }
